Add file to the project:
	Open up the terminal and change directory until you're inside the		folder, where your "code" are stored.
	cd folder
	
	Next initialize Git so you can start using Git commands inside the folder. The folder is now a Git repository.
	git init

	Make sure this is where you stored your code.
	git status

	Add them to your local Git repository so they'll be tracked by Git.
	git add yourfile.php

	Take "snapshot" of the repository as it stands now with the commit command.
	git commit -m "Add yourfile.php"

	Connect your local file with Github
	git remote add origin https://github/username/repository.git

	If you write wrong username, go to .git/config and change it in your computer.

	Double check to make sure it knows
	git remote -v

	Upload
	git push

	If you have an error when you use the "push" command then:
	Error: failed to push
	![rejected]    master->master(non-fast forward)
	error: failed to push some ref to ......
		Solution
			git pull origin master
		or
			git fetch origin
			git merge origin master
	and make the "push" again.
